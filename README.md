# CvT: Introducing Convolutions to Vision Transformers.


Tensorflow implementation of CvT: Introducing Convolutions to Vision Transformers, for official repo please visit here: https://github.com/microsoft/CvT#readme

Convolutional vision Transformers (CvT), that improves Vision Transformers (ViT) in performance and efficienty by introducing convolutions into ViT to yield the best of both disignes. This is accomplished through two primary modifications: a hierarchy of Transformers containing a new convolutional token embedding, and a convolutional Transformer block leveraging a convolutional projection.
